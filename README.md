# Project Title: Mario Level Scene Graphics in C++

## Description:
This project is a demonstration of graphics programming in C++ using the BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) library. It recreates a scene reminiscent of the classic Mario game, featuring Mario himself, various obstacles, and environment elements such as clouds, platforms, and a castle. The graphics are drawn using various algorithms for drawing lines and circles, including Bresenham's line algorithm and the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm. The program generates a graphical representation of the Mario game level and character on the screen.

## Features:
- Implementation of Bresenham's line algorithm and DDA algorithm for drawing lines.
- Drawing of circles using Bresenham's circle drawing algorithm.
- Creation of various environment elements such as clouds, platforms, and a castle.
- Drawing of Mario character including his hat, body, arms, and legs.
- Integration of flood-fill algorithm for coloring elements.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/as-salad-code/CPP-Graphics-Mario>
   ```
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler with support for the BGI library (e.g., Turbo C++).
3. Run the compiled executable to see the Mario Level Scene graphics.

## Usage:
1. After compiling and running the program, a window will appear displaying the Mario Level Scene graphics.
2. Enjoy the graphical representation of the Mario game environment.
